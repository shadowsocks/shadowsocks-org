        Things should be simple. We believe in testing and so we want to make it as simple as possible.

          The main goal for Karma is to bring a productive testing
          environment to developers. The environment being one where they don&#39;t have
          to set up loads of configurations, but rather a place where developers can just write the
          code and get instant feedback from their tests. Because getting quick feedback is what makes you
          productive and [creative](http://vimeo.com/36579366).
