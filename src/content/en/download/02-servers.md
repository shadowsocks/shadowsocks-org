## Python

shadowsocks-python is the initial version written by [@clowwindy]. It aims to provide a simple-to-use and easy-to-deploy implementation with basic features of shadowsocks.

#### PyPI

First, make sure you have Python 2.6 or 2.7.

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.6.8
```

Then install from PIP

```bash
$ pip install shadowsocks
```

## Go from Outline

[outline-ss-server](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-ss-server) is the shadowsocks implementation used by the Outline Server, but it can be used standalone. Main features:
* Multiple users on a single port and multiple ports.
* Whitebox monitoring of the service using [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io)
* Live updates via config change + SIGHUP
* Prohibits unsafe access to localhost ports and usage of non-AEAD ciphers

#### GitHub

Download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-ss-server/releases) or build it from source:
```
go get github.com/Jigsaw-code/outline-ss-server
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/outline-ss-server -config=config.yml -metrics=127.0.0.1:9091
```

## C with libev

shadowsocks-libev is a lightweight and full featured port for embedded devices
and low end boxes. It's a pure C implementation and has a very small footprint
(several megabytes) for thousands of connections. This port is maintained by [@madeye].

#### Debian/Ubuntu:

shadowsocks-libev is available in the official repository for Debian
9("Stretch"), unstable, Ubuntu 16.10 and later derivatives:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install shadowsocks-libev
```

For Debian Jessie users, please install it from jessie-backports:

```
sudo sh -c 'printf "deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-backports
main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie-backports.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -t jessie-backports install shadowsocks-libev
```

#### Docker

shadowsocks-libev is shipped also in containers, which makes it a great choice if your cloud provider is Docker-ready or if you aim to build a scalable solution.

```
docker pull shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev
docker run -e PASSWORD=<password> -p<server-port>:8388 -p<server-port>:8388/udp -d shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev
```

More information about the image can be found [here](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev/blob/master/docker/alpine/README.md).

#### GitHub

Build and install the project from source code.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends build-essential autoconf libtool \
        libssl-dev gawk debhelper dh-systemd init-system-helpers pkg-config asciidoc \
        xmlto apg libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libev-dev libudns-dev libsodium-dev libmbedtls-dev libc-ares-dev automake
$ git clone https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev.git
$ cd shadowsocks-libev
$ git submodule update --init
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
```

is maintained by [@librehat].

#### Prebuilt binaries

Download pre-built binaries from https://github.com/shadowsocks/libQtShadowsocks/releases

#### GitHub

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shadowsocks/libQtShadowsocks.git
$ cd libQtShadowsocks

## Perl

Net::Shadowsocks is an asynchronous, non-blocking Shadowsocks client and server Perl module maintained by [@zhou0].

#### Setting up

You need a Perl interpreter to execute Perl program. Any Unix-like system, including Linux and Mac OS X, has Perl pre-installed. Windows does not have Perl installed by default, so you need to install Strawberry Perl. The source code is available on CPAN and github. Download from CPAN https://metacpan.org/release/Net-Shadowsocks or download from github https://github.com/zhou0/shadowsocks-perl

#### Installing

On Unix-like systems, either

 ```bash
$ perl Build.PL
$ ./Build
$ ./Build test
$ ./Build install
```
or
```bash
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ make install
```
You might need to change `make` to `dmake` or `nmake` depending on the compiler toolchain used on Windows. If you have cpan, you can also install using this command:
```bash
$ cpan Net::Shadowsocks
```

#### Running

There is a server.pl script under the `eg` directory. Put your `config.json` in the same directory as `server.pl` and
run the `server.pl` script there.
